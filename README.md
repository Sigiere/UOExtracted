Extracted Items

I am currently Extracting and labeling all items in UO using UOFiddler.
The file names are "itemname" "slotnumber".bmp
I am extracting the most common items first.
As I do this I am creating my [ItemDef ] and [TypeDef ] scripts.

This is the beginning of a major project where as the goal is to have the best, fastest and most balanced Server on the net where people can play for free.

This has been a long term goal of mine for some time due to the over abundant amount of posers and greedy people on the net claiming to be good ganer admins when really, they are just as bad as osi.

I have seen everything from people creating custom monsters so hard that you have to purchase a custom pet from the just to play in the dungeons. I have also seen some idiots selling houses within the guard protected boundaries of the cities.

Once the extractions are done, I will begin on the server itself and getting online.
After a few people log in and my custom shard has been running for a few weeks without any trouble, I will be sharing my custom scripts.
Afterall, it's not business, it's just a game to have fun.
